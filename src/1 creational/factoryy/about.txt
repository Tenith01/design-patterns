Intent:

    To create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created

Problem:

    Creating an object directly, using the new keyword, can lead to tight coupling between the client code and the class of the object being created

Solution:

    Define a separate factory class that knows how to create objects, but not the exact class of the objects that will be created
    The client code uses the factory to create objects, rather than creating them directly
    The factory can create different types of objects based on the input it receives

Real-World Analogy:

    The factory pattern is similar to a car factory that produces cars of different models without specifying the exact class of the car that will be produced.
