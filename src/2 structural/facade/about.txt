Intent:

    To provide a simple and easy-to-use interface to a complex system.

Problem:

    A complex system can be difficult to use and understand.
    A complex system can have many dependencies and interfaces, making it hard to implement and maintain.

Solution:

    Create a facade class that acts as an interface to the complex system.
    The facade class defines a simple and easy-to-use interface that the client code can use to interact with the complex system.
    The facade class delegates requests from the client code to the appropriate classes within the complex system.

Real-World Analogy:

    A facade pattern is similar to a remote control of a TV. A remote control provides a simple interface to the complex TV system,
    allowing you to change channels, adjust the volume, and so on, without having to know how the TV works internally.
